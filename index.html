    <h1> Chemistry Assignment </h1> 

<p> Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe</p>

<h2>Chemical Elements</h2>

<p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>

<h3> Chemical Equations</h3>

<p> <i>Chemical reactions</i> are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:</p>

2H<sub>2</sub> +O<sub>2</sub> - 2H<sub>2</sub>

<p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H₂) and oxygen gas (O2) to form water (H₂O).</p>

<h4>Important concepts</h4>

<p> <b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved. <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
